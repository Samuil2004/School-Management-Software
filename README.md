# This is a school management software that I developed in C# using WinForms and SQL database. At the log in page their is an admin acess, teacher acess and a student acess. Admins have the ability to manage all the data
and change whatever they want to. Teachers have the opportunity to mark attendance to students, as well as leave comments and insert grades. Students have the ability to check their week schedule, check grades, semester
grades, current average score and some other features. I would suggest you to pull and test it, it is worth, I promise :)
